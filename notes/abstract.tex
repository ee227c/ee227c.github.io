This course explores some theory and algorithms for nonlinear optimization. We
will focus on problems that arise in machine learning and modern data analysis,
paying attention to concerns about complexity, robustness, and implementation in
these domains. We will also see how tools from convex optimization can help
tackle non-convex optimization problems common in practice.
